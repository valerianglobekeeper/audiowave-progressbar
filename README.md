Super lightweight audiowave progressbar written in Kotlin



<img src="imgs/wave.gif"/>


## Getting started

Add to your root build.gradle:
```Groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
	    ...
	    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

Add the dependency:
```Groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.github.alxrm:audiowave-progressbar:0.9.4'
}
```

## Attrs
|attr|format|description|
|---|:---|:---:|
|waveColor|color|with this color chunks will be filled|
|chunkWidth|dimension|every chunk will have this width|
|chunkHeight|dimension|maximum height all the chunks can be|
|minChunkHeight|dimension|minimum height all the chunks can be|
|chunkSpacing|dimension|spacing between chunks|
|chunkRadius|dimension|how much corners of every chunk will be rounded|
|progress|float|should be 0..100, it's float so you can easily animate this|
|animateExpansion|boolean|toggle the animated expansion|
|touchable|boolean|toggle to use it as a seekbar, default value is `true`|

__Note: If you are going to place this in a RecyclerView item, you have to set `animateExpansion` to `false`, otherwise you'll see an incredibly laggy scroll (check out the example)__

## In code

Settle the wave somewhere in your XML like this:

```xml
<rm.com.audiowave.AudioWaveView
    android:id="@+id/wave"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="32dp"
    android:layout_margin="16dp"
    app:animateExpansion="false"
    app:chunkWidth="3dp"
    app:chunkHeight="24dp"
    app:minChunkHeight="2dp"
    app:chunkSpacing="1dp"
    app:chunkRadius="1dp"
    app:touchable="true"
    app:waveColor="@android:color/white"
    />
```

## API

Set raw byte array asynchronously 

```java
// does downsampling in O(N) and shows the animation you see in a gif above (the inflation-like one)
setRawData(byte[] data);

// you also have the ability to listen, when does the downsampling complete
setRawData(byte[] data, OnSamplingListener callback);
```

In case you have a scaled byte array you want to draw, i. e. an array whose size is the amount of chunks to draw


```java
// instantly redraws the wave without async downsampling process
setScaledData(byte[] scaledData);
```

You can use it like a `Seekbar`, it reacts on touches, just attach listener

```java
wave.setOnProgressListener(OnProgressListener listener);
```

__Note:__ that `setOnProgressListener` is a Java style API and with Kotlin you have to set it like this:

```kotlin
wave.onProgressListener = object : OnProgressListener {...}
```

This listener has 3 methods like a built-in `Seekbar`

```java
void onStartTracking(float progress) {
  // invokes when user touches the view
}

void onStopTracking(float progress) {
  // invokes when user releases the touch
}

void onProgressChanged(float progress, boolean byUser) {
  // invokes every time the progress's been changed
}
```

__Kotlin__ users can listen `Seekbar` event in a more convenient and clean way with __properties__:

```kotlin
wave.onStopTracking = {
  Log.d("wave", "Progress set: $it")
}

wave.onStartTracking = {
  Log.d("wave", "Started tracking from: $it")
}

wave.onProgressChanged = {progress, byUser ->
  Log.d("wave", "Progress set: $progress, and it's $byUser that user did this")
}
```

## Contribution

There are some features(like better precision) I am about to implement, but a little bit later. 
If you'd like to help, you are always free to send pull requests or issues if you only want to suggest something 

**Note:** All your pull requests should be written in kotlin
